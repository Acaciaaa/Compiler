# Compiler
This is a compiler principally written by C++ which could compile SysY, a simpler version of C, to RISC-V, using Koopa IR as intermediate representation.

This [link](https://pku-minic.github.io/online-doc/#/) is the intact document serving to demonstrate demands and guide readers to complete their compiler step by step, from translating source code to IR to outputting RISC-V code. The whole process contains 9 basic levels and optimizing part, and every level requires readers to complement several more functions, such as computing expressions, defining variables and functions, handling _if/else_ and _while_ patterns as well as dealing with arrays...

Report.md is the final report written to interpret my code and the whole process and workpath src contains all resource code. The details with respect to environment and test methods are included in above link.

(It's such a tremendous challenge that it took me months to finish my compiler! Definitely worth a try!)
